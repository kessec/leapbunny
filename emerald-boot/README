emerald-boot -- Emerald Platform LF1000 first-stage NAND Flash Bootloader

################
# introduction #
################

emerald-boot bootstraps the system from a NOR Flash.  It also includes basic 
NAND Flash support (with hardware ECC) and LCD controller support.  A polling 
UART driver is included for debugging purposes.

emerald-boot's task is to:
        0) Bootstrap itself, as needed: When booting from NAND, the hardware 
           loads 0x800 of emerald-boot, and emerald-boot then loads the rest.
           When booting from NOR, emerald-boot copies itself out of NOR and
           into RAM.
        1) Enable system VCC and perform some basic CPU and hardware
           initialization.
        2) Read which kernel image to boot and the kernel command line 
           arguments to use.
	3) Read a splash screen into memory, set up the LCD controller, and
           display it.
        4) Fetch that kernel image and load it into SDRAM.
        5) Boot the kernel image, with kernel command line arguments passed in.

The bootloader also includes a device recovery mode which utilizes USB mass
storage.  It's entered automatically in cases where the kernel cannot be loaded
successfully.

# installation #
################

emerald-boot is built using some headers from the Linux kernel.  The 
install.sh script copies these headers and then uses 'make' to build the 
bootloader.  First, configure and build an LF1000 kernel for the board that you
wish to build emerald-boot for (ie: set the TARGET_MACH).  Next, build
emerald-boot:

./install.sh

If you want a clean build, use the '-c' option:

./install.sh -c

If you want UART debugging:

DEBUG=1 ./install.sh

The install script copies emerald-boot.bin to your $TFTP_PATH.

# Development and Debugging #

If you want to turn off self-bootstrapping (ex: to test emerald-boot from
u-boot or via JTAG), remove the SELF_BOOTSTRAP option from CFLAGS in the
Makefile and then recompile.  Be aware that SELF_BOOTSTRAP must be enabled for
any build that you intend to write into Flash.

Basic profiling is available in DEBUG mode.  Define DEBUG_STOPWATCH, for
example:

DEBUG=1 DEBUG_STOPWATCH=1 ./install.sh -c

to enable it.  This will turn on stopwatch code provided by the 
db_stopwatch_start() and db_stopwatch_stop() routines.  See the comments in
timer.c for details on the timer 'tick' rate.

See the LinuxDist README for information on variables that should be exported
for the install script.
