bang/touch/hold (duration: <10, <50, >=50)

hold-drag (colinear: flick)
hold-drag (non-colinear: drag)
touch-drag (colinear: swipe)
touch-drag (hold too; colinear, anti-colinear: scrub)

---

If not expecting drags, but expecting swipes, then all drags are swipes

---

Paremeters we can test:

dot product: +1 to -1: along or anti-along overall arc -- this is an array of values
total arc_length
move_len: Since start of touch
velocity: arc_len / move_time
linearity: arc_len / move_len

----

More about swipes:

We can latch an axis: X or Y, then
Track motion on this axis for scrubbing.

A touch becomes a swipe if it starts moving before it becomes a hold

----

Want to give these events:

touch	     	   on_touch_down  on_touch_up
hold		   on_hold_down	on_hold_up (tracking)
bang smite	   on_bang
squash grind	   on_squash
flick  		   
swipe		   on
scrub		   on_scrub (when released)
lasso		   on_lasso (center point?  Path?)

----

* Do we want to "register" for certain events, and have the driver be
  smart about what it reports?

* Do we want possibly conflicting events reported, and it is the apps
  responsibilit to when it sees the second event, ignore the first?
  Or vice-versa?
