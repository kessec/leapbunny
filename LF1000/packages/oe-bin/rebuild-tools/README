Tools for helping with oe-bin rebuilds

To use:
1. Untar the existing tar into image-old
2. Copy the image directory from the working directory in OE
3. Run clean-image.sh
	This will open a meld window with the old image on the left and the new one on the right.
	Files and their md5 checksums appear at the top of the image list, directories at the bottom.
4. After you are satisfied with the new image, run deploy-bin.sh with the name of the tar as the argument
5. Run clean-staging.sh to prepare for the next tar

Notes:
1. You must have meld installed to use clean-image.sh
2. The scripts assume your LinuxDist checkout is at ~/workspace/LinuxDist
3. deploy-bin.sh leaves a copy of the new tar in the current directory to help keep track of what packages have been rebuilt
