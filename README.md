# LeapBunny
### The unofficial continuation of the Leapster OS that came on the Leapster Explorer devices.

##### Everything is written with the assumption that you are using the Kessec [Froggy](http://github.com/kessec/froggy) Board or something similar and planning to boot the LeapBunny Operating System off an SD card.

##### Move the RidgeRun folder into the /opt/ folder on Linux and source crosscompile_env_vars before you compile anything for a LeapBunny device.
